 * brief
 *   Update CMSIS SystemCoreClock variable.
 *
 * details
 *   CMSIS defines a global variable SystemCoreClock that shall hold the
 *   core frequency in Hz. If the core frequency is dynamically changed, the
 *   variable must be kept updated in order to be CMSIS compliant.
 *
 *   Notice that if only changing core clock frequency through the EFM32 CMU
 *   API, this variable will be kept updated. This function is only provided
 *   for CMSIS compliance and if a user modifies the the core clock outside
 *   the CMU API.
