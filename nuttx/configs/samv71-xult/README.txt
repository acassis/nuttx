Serial Console
==============

The SAMV71-XULT has no on-board RS-232 drivers so it will be necessary to
use either the VCOM or an external RS-232 driver.  Here are some options.

  - Arduino Serial Shield:  One option is to use an Arduino-compatible
    serial shield.  This will use the RXD and TXD signals available at pins
    0 an 1, respectively, of the Arduino "Digital Low" connector.  On the
    SAMV71-XULT board, this corresponds to UART3:

    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------
    Pin on SAMV71 Arduino Arduino SAMV71
    J503   PIO    Name    Pin     Function
    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------
      1    PD28   RX0     0       URXD3
      2    PD30   TX0     1       UTXD3
    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------

  - SAMV7-XULT EXTn connectors.  USART pins are also available the EXTn
    connectors.  The following are labelled in the User Guide for USART
    functionality:

    ---- -------- ------ --------
    EXT1 EXTI1    SAMV71 SAMV71
    Pin  Name     PIO    Function
    ---- -------- ------ --------
    13   USART_RX PB00   RXD0
    14   USART_TX PB01   TXD0

    ---- -------- ------ --------
    EXT2 EXTI2    SAMV71 SAMV71
    Pin  Name     PIO    Function
    ---- -------- ------ --------
    13   USART_RX PA21   RXD1
    14   USART_TX PB04   TXD1

  - VCOM.  The Virtual Com Port gateway is available on USART1:

    ------ --------
    SAMV71 SAMV71
    PIO    Function
    ------ --------
    PB04   TXD1
    PA21   RXD1
    ------ --------

Any of these options can be selected as the serial console by:

  1. Enabling the UART/USART peripheral in the
     "System Type -> Peripheral Selection" menu, then
  2. Configuring the peripheral in the "Drivers -> Serial Configuration"
     menu.

SD Card
=======

Card Slot
---------
The SAM V71 Xplained Ultra has one standard SD card connector which is
connected to the High Speed Multimedia Card Interface (HSMCI) of the SAM
V71. SD card connector:

  ------ ----------------- ---------------------

  Pin    Function
  ------ ----------------- ---------------------

  PA28   MCCDA (CMD)
  PD18   Card Detect (C/D) Shield
  ------ ----------------- ---------------------

Configuration Settings
----------------------
Enabling HSMCI support. The SAMV7-XULT provides a one, full-size SD memory card slots.  The full size SD card slot connects via HSMCI0.  Support for the SD slots can be enabled with the following settings:

  System Type->SAMV7 Peripheral Selection
    CONFIG_SAMV7_HSMCI0=y                 : To enable HSMCI0 support
    CONFIG_SAMV7_XDMAC=y                  : XDMAC is needed by HSMCI0/1

  System Type
    CONFIG_SAMV7_PIO_IRQ=y                : PIO interrupts needed
    CONFIG_SAMV7_PIOD_IRQ=y               : Card detect pin is on PD18

  Device Drivers -> MMC/SD Driver Support
    CONFIG_MMCSD=y                        : Enable MMC/SD support
    CONFIG_MMSCD_NSLOTS=1                 : One slot per driver instance
    CONFIG_MMCSD_MULTIBLOCK_DISABLE=y     : (REVISIT)
    CONFIG_MMCSD_HAVECARDDETECT=y         : Supports card-detect PIOs
    CONFIG_MMCSD_MMCSUPPORT=n             : Interferes with some SD cards
    CONFIG_MMCSD_SPI=n                    : No SPI-based MMC/SD support
    CONFIG_MMCSD_SDIO=y                   : SDIO-based MMC/SD support
    CONFIG_SDIO_DMA=y                     : Use SDIO DMA
    CONFIG_SDIO_BLOCKSETUP=y              : Needs to know block sizes

  RTOS Features -> Work Queue Support
    CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE=y              : Driver needs work queue support

  Application Configuration -> NSH Library
    CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y                 : NSH board-initialization, OR
    CONFIG_BOARD_INITIALIZE=y

Using the SD card
-----------------

1) After booting, the HSCMI device will appear as /dev/mmcsd0.

2) If you try mounting an SD card with nothing in the slot, the mount will
   fail:

     nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/sd0
     nsh: mount: mount failed: 19

   NSH can be configured to provide errors as strings instead of
   numbers.  But in this case, only the error number is reported.  The
   error numbers can be found in nuttx/include/errno.h:

     #define ENODEV              19
     #define ENODEV_STR          "No such device"

   So the mount command is saying that there is no device or, more
   correctly, that there is no card in the SD card slot.

3) Inserted the SD card.  Then the mount should succeed.

    nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/sd0
    nsh> ls /mnt/sd1
    /mnt/sd1:
     atest.txt
    nsh> cat /mnt/sd1/atest.txt
    This is a test

   NOTE:  See the next section entitled "Auto-Mounter" for another way
   to mount your SD card.

4) Before removing the card, you must umount the file system.  This is
   equivalent to "ejecting" or "safely removing" the card on Windows:  It
   flushes any cached data to an SD card and makes the SD card unavailable
   to the applications.

     nsh> umount -t /mnt/sd0

   It is now safe to remove the card.  NuttX provides into callbacks
   that can be used by an application to automatically unmount the
   volume when it is removed.  But those callbacks are not used in
   these configurations.

Auto-Mounter
============

  NuttX implements an auto-mounter than can make working with SD cards
  easier.  With the auto-mounter, the file system will be automatically
  mounted when the SD card is inserted into the HSMCI slot and automatically
  unmounted when the SD card is removed.

  Here is a sample configuration for the auto-mounter:

    File System Configuration
      CONFIG_FS_AUTOMOUNTER=y

    Board-Specific Options
      CONFIG_SAMV7XULT_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT=y
      CONFIG_SAMV7XULT_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_FSTYPE="vfat"
      CONFIG_SAMV7XULT_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_BLKDEV="/dev/mmcsd0"
      CONFIG_SAMV7XULT_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_MOUNTPOINT="/mnt/sdcard"
      CONFIG_SAMV7XULT_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_DDELAY=1000
      CONFIG_SAMV7XULT_HSMCI0_AUTOMOUNT_UDELAY=2000

  WARNING:  SD cards should never be removed without first unmounting
  them.  This is to avoid data and possible corruption of the file
  system.  Certainly this is the case if you are writing to the SD card
  at the time of the removal.  If you use the SD card for read-only access,
  however, then I cannot think of any reason why removing the card without
  mounting would be harmful.

LEDs and Buttons
================

LEDs
----
There are two yellow LED available on the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board that
can be turned on and off.  The LEDs can be activated by driving the
connected I/O line to GND.

  ------ ----------- ---------------------
  SAMV71 Function    Shared functionality
  PIO
  ------ ----------- ---------------------
  PA23   Yellow LED0 EDBG GPIO
  PC09   Yellow LED1 LCD, and Shield
  ------ ----------- ---------------------

These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
include/board.h and src/sam_autoleds.c. The LEDs are used to encode
OS-related events as follows:

  -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
  SYMBOL                Meaning                     LED state
                                                  LED0     LED1
  -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
  LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started     OFF      OFF
  LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated    OFF      OFF
  LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled         OFF      OFF
  LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created         ON       OFF
  LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt              No change
  LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler          No change
  LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed          No change
  LED_PANIC            The system has crashed     N/C      Blinking
  LED_IDLE             MCU is is sleep mode         Not used
  -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------

Thus if LED0 is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and is,
apparently, running normally.  If LED1 is flashing at approximately
2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

NOTE: That LED0 is not used after completion of booting and may
be used by other board-specific logic.

Buttons
-------
SAM V71 Xplained Ultra contains three mechanical buttons. One button is the
RESET button connected to the SAM V71 reset line and the others are generic
user configurable buttons. When a button is pressed it will drive the I/O
line to GND.

  PA09   SW0         EDBG GPIO and Camera
  PB12   SW1         EDBG SWD and Chip Erase
  ------ ----------- ---------------------

NOTES:

  - There are no pull-up resistors connected to the generic user buttons so
    it is necessary to enable the internal pull-up in the SAM V71 to use the
    button.
  - PB12 is set up as a system flash ERASE pin when the firmware boots. To
    use the SW1, PB12 has to be configured as a normal regular I/O pin in
    the MATRIX module. For more information see the SAM V71 datasheet.

AT24MAC402 Serial EEPROM
========================

The SAM V71 Xplained Ultra features one external AT24MAC402 serial EEPROM
with a EIA-48 MAC address connected to the SAM V71 through I2C. This device
contains a MAC address for use with the Ethernet interface.

Connectivity:

  ------ -------- -------- ------------------------------------------

I2C address:

  The 7-bit address of the AT24 part is is 0b1011AAA where AAA is the state
  of the A0, A1, and A3 pins on the part.  On the SAMV71-XULT board, these
  are all pulled high so the full, 7-bit address is 0x5f.

Debugging
=========

The on-board EDBG appears to work only with Atmel Studio.  You can however,
simply connect a SAM-ICE or J-Link to the JTAG/SWD connector on the board
and that works great.  The only tricky thing is getting the correct
orientation of the JTAG connection.

I have been using Atmel Studio to write code to flash then I use the Segger
J-Link GDB server to debug.  I have been using the 'Device Programming' I
available under the Atmel Studio 'Tool' menu.  I have to disconnect the
SAM-ICE while programming with the EDBG.  I am sure that you could come up
with a GDB server-only solution if you wanted.

I run GDB like this from the directory containing the NuttX ELF file:

  arm-none-eabi-gdb
  (gdb) target remote localhost:2331
  (gdb) mon reset
  (gdb) file nuttx
  (gdb) ... start debugging ...

Configurations
==============

Information Common to All Configurations
----------------------------------------
Each SAMV71-XULT configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow:

  cd tools
  ./configure.sh samv71-xult/<subdir>
  cd -
  . ./setenv.sh

Before sourcing the setenv.sh file above, you should examine it and perform
edits as necessary so that TOOLCHAIN_BIN is the correct path to the directory
than holds your toolchain binaries.

And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

  make oldconfig
  make

The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
must be is one of the following.

NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       and misc/tools/

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on USART3 (i.e., for the Arduino serial shield).

  3. All of these configurations are set up to build under Windows using the
     "GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors" that is maintained by ARM
     (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).

       https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

     As of this writing (2015-03-11), full support is difficult to find
     for the Cortex-M&, but is supported by at least this realeasse of
     the ARM GNU tools:

       https://launchpadlibrarian.net/192228215/release.txt

     That toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using
     'make menuconfig'.  Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Window environment
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Cywin under Windows

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : GNU ARM EABI toolchain

Configuration sub-directories
-----------------------------

  nsh:

    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.
    NOTES:

    1. The serial console is configured by default for use with and Arduino
       serial shield (UART3).  You will need to reconfigure if you will
       to use a different U[S]ART.

    2. Default stack sizes are large and should really be tuned to reduce
       the RAM footprint:

         CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK=2048
         CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE=1024
         CONFIG_USERMAIN_STACKSIZE=2048
         CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT=2048
         ... and others ...

    3. NSH built-in applications are supported.

       Binary Formats:
         CONFIG_BUILTIN=y           : Enable support for built-in programs

       Application Configuration:
         CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS=y  : Enable starting apps from NSH command line

    4. SDRAM is not enabled in this configuration.  I have enabled SDRAM and
       the apps/examples RAM test using this configuration settings:

       System Type
         CONFIG_SAMV7_SDRAMC=y
         CONFIG_SAMV7_SDRAMSIZE=2097152

       Application Configuration:
         CONFIG_SYSTEM_RAMTEST=y

       The RAM test can be executed as follows:

         nsh> ramtest -w 70000000 209152

       STATUS: As of this writing, SDRAM does not pass the RAM test.  This is the sympton:

        nsh> mw 70000000
          70000000 = 0x00000000
        nsh> mw 70000000=55555555
          70000000 = 0x00000000 -> 0x55555555
        nsh> mw 70000000
          70000000 = 0x55555555

        nsh> mw 70100000
          70100000 = 0x00000000
        nsh> mw 70100000=aaaaaaaa
          70100000 = 0x00000000 -> 0xaaaaaaaa
        nsh> mw 70100000
          70100000 = 0xaaaaaaaa

        nsh> mw 70000000
          70000000 = 0x00000000 <<< Lost RAM content

    5. The button test at apps/examples/buttons is included in the
       configuration.  This configuration illustrates (1) use of the buttons
       on the evaluation board, and (2) the use of PIO interrupts.  Example
       usage:

       NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-7.8
       nsh> help
       help usage:  help [-v] [<cmd>]
       ...
       Builtin Apps:
         buttons
       nsh> buttons 3
       maxbuttons: 3
       Attached handler at 4078f7 to button 0 [SW0], oldhandler:0
       Attached handler at 4078e9 to button 1 [SW1], oldhandler:0
       IRQ:125 Button 1:SW1 SET:00:
         SW1 released
       IRQ:125 Button 1:SW1 SET:02:
         SW1 depressed
       IRQ:125 Button 1:SW1 SET:00:
         SW1 released
       IRQ:90 Button 0:SW0 SET:01:
         SW0 depressed
       IRQ:90 Button 0:SW0 SET:00:
         SW0 released
       IRQ:125 Button 1:SW1 SET:02:
         SW1 depressed
       nsh>

    6. TWI/I2C

       TWIHS0 is enabled in this configuration.  The SAM V71 Xplained Ultra
       supports two devices on the one on-board I2C device on the TWIHS0 bus:
       (1) The AT24MAC402 serial EEPROM described above and (2) the Wolfson
       WM8904 audio CODEC.  This device contains a MAC address for use with
       the Ethernet interface.

       In this configuration, the I2C tool at apps/system/i2ctool is
       enabled.  This tools supports interactive access to I2C devices on
       the enabled TWIHS bus.  Relevant configuration settings:

         CONFIG_SAMV7_TWIHS0=y
         CONFIG_SAMV7_TWIHS0_FREQUENCY=100000

         CONFIG_I2C=y
         CONFIG_I2C_TRANSFER=y

         CONFIG_SYSTEM_I2CTOOL=y
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MINBUS=0
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MAXBUS=0
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MINADDR=0x03
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MAXADDR=0x77
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MAXREGADDR=0xff
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_DEFFREQ=400000

       Example usage:

         nsh> i2c
         Usage: i2c <cmd> [arguments]
         Where <cmd> is one of:

           Show help     : ?
           List busses   : bus
           List devices  : dev [OPTIONS] <first> <last>
           Read register : get [OPTIONS] [<repititions>]
           Show help     : help
           Write register: set [OPTIONS] <value> [<repititions>]
           Verify access : verf [OPTIONS] [<value>] [<repititions>]

         Where common "sticky" OPTIONS include:
           [-a addr] is the I2C device address (hex).  Default: 03 Current: 03
           [-b bus] is the I2C bus number (decimal).  Default: 0 Current: 0
           [-r regaddr] is the I2C device register address (hex).  Default: 00 Current: 00
           [-w width] is the data width (8 or 16 decimal).  Default: 8 Current: 8
           [-s|n], send/don't send start between command and data.  Default: -n Current: -n
           [-i|j], Auto increment|don't increment regaddr on repititions.  Default: NO Current: NO
           [-f freq] I2C frequency.  Default: 400000 Current: 400000

         NOTES:
         o An environment variable like $PATH may be used for any argument.
         o Arguments are "sticky".  For example, once the I2C address is
           specified, that address will be re-used until it is changed.

         WARNING:
         o The I2C dev command may have bad side effects on your I2C devices.
           Use only at your own risk.
