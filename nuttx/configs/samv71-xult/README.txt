Serial Console
==============

The SAMV71-XULT has no on-board RS-232 drivers so it will be necessary to
use either the VCOM or an external RS-232 driver.  Here are some options.

  - Arduino Serial Shield:  One option is to use an Arduino-compatible
    serial shield.  This will use the RXD and TXD signals available at pins
    0 an 1, respectively, of the Arduino "Digital Low" connector.  On the
    SAMV71-XULT board, this corresponds to UART3:

    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------
    Pin on SAMV71 Arduino Arduino SAMV71
    J503   PIO    Name    Pin     Function
    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------
      1    PD28   RX0     0       URXD3
      2    PD30   TX0     1       UTXD3
    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------

  - SAMV7-XULT EXTn connectors.  USART pins are also available the EXTn
    connectors.  The following are labelled in the User Guide for USART
    functionality:

    ---- -------- ------ --------
    EXT1 EXTI1    SAMV71 SAMV71
    Pin  Name     PIO    Function
    ---- -------- ------ --------
    13   USART_RX PB00   RXD0
    14   USART_TX PB01   TXD0

    ---- -------- ------ --------
    EXT2 EXTI2    SAMV71 SAMV71
    Pin  Name     PIO    Function
    ---- -------- ------ --------
    13   USART_RX PA21   RXD1
    14   USART_TX PB04   TXD1

  - VCOM.  The Virtual Com Port gateway is available on USART1:

    ------ --------
    SAMV71 SAMV71
    PIO    Function
    ------ --------
    PB04   TXD1
    PA21   RXD1
    ------ --------

Any of these options can be selected as the serial console by:

  1. Enabling the UART/USART peripheral in the
     "System Type -> Peripheral Selection" menu, then
  2. Configuring the peripheral in the "Drivers -> Serial Configuration"
     menu.

LEDs and Buttons
================

LEDs
----
There are two yellow LED available on the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board that
can be turned on and off.  The LEDs can be activated by driving the
connected I/O line to GND.

  ------ ----------- ---------------------
  SAMV71 Function    Shared functionality
  PIO
  ------ ----------- ---------------------
  PA23   Yellow LED0 EDBG GPIO
  PC09   Yellow LED1 LCD, and Shield
  ------ ----------- ---------------------

These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
include/board.h and src/sam_autoleds.c. The LEDs are used to encode
OS-related events as follows:

  -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
  SYMBOL                Meaning                     LED state
                                                  LED0     LED1
  -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
  LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started     OFF      OFF
  LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated    OFF      OFF
  LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled         OFF      OFF
  LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created         ON       OFF
  LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt              No change
  LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler          No change
  LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed          No change
  LED_PANIC            The system has crashed     N/C      Blinking
  LED_IDLE             MCU is is sleep mode         Not used
  -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------

Thus if LED0 is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and is,
apparently, running normally.  If LED1 is flashing at approximately
2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

NOTE: That LED0 is not used after completion of booting and may
be used by other board-specific logic.

Buttons
-------
SAM V71 Xplained Ultra contains three mechanical buttons. One button is the
RESET button connected to the SAM V71 reset line and the others are generic
user configurable buttons. When a button is pressed it will drive the I/O
line to GND.

  PA09   SW0         EDBG GPIO and Camera
  PB12   SW1         EDBG SWD and Chip Erase
  ------ ----------- ---------------------

NOTES:

  - There are no pull-up resistors connected to the generic user buttons so
    it is necessary to enable the internal pull-up in the SAM V71 to use the
    button.
  - PB12 is set up as a system flash ERASE pin when the firmware boots. To
    use the SW1, PB12 has to be configured as a normal regular I/O pin in
    the MATRIX module. For more information see the SAM V71 datasheet.

Configurations
==============

  Information Common to All Configurations
  ----------------------------------------
  Each SAMV71-XULT configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    cd tools
    ./configure.sh samv71-xult/<subdir>
    cd -
    . ./setenv.sh

  Before sourcing the setenv.sh file above, you should examine it and perform
  edits as necessary so that TOOLCHAIN_BIN is the correct path to the directory
  than holds your toolchain binaries.

  And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
  the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

    make oldconfig
    make

  The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
  must be is one of the following.

  NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       and misc/tools/

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on USART3 (i.e., for the Arduino serial shield).

  3. All of these configurations are set up to build under Windows using the
     devkitARM toolchain (unless stated otherwise in the description of
     the configuration).  That build selection can easily be reconfigured
     using 'make menuconfig'.  Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Window environment
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Cywin under Windows

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_DEVKITARM=y : devkitARM toolchain

    You an get the free devkitARM toolchain from http://devkitpro.org/ or
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/

  Configuration sub-directories
  -----------------------------

  nsh:

    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.
    NOTES:

    1. The serial console is configured by default for use with and Arduino
       serial shield (UART3).  You will need to reconfigure if you will
       to use a different U[S]ART.

    2. Default stack sizes are large and should really be tuned to reduce
       the RAM footprint:

         CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK=2048
         CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE=1024
         CONFIG_USERMAIN_STACKSIZE=2048
         CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT=2048
         ... and others ...

    3. NSH built-in applications are supported.

       Binary Formats:
         CONFIG_BUILTIN=y                    : Enable support for built-in programs

       Application Configuration:
         CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS=y           : Enable starting apps from NSH command line

    4. Performance-related Configuration settings:

       # CONFIG_ARMV7M_ICACHE is not set     : Can be enabled, not verified
       # CONFIG_ARMV7M_DCACHE is not set     : Can be enabled, not verified
       # CONFIG_ARCH_FPU is not set          : Can be enabled, not verified
       # CONFIG_ARMV7M_ITCM is not set       : Support not yet in place
       # CONFIG_ARMV7M_DTCM is not set       : Support not yet in place
