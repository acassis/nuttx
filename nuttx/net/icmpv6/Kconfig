config NET_ICMPv6
	bool "Enable ICMPv6 networking"
	default n
	depends on NET
	---help---
		Enable minimal ICMPv6 support. Includes built-in support
		for sending replies to received ECHO (ping) requests.

if NET_ICMPv6

config NET_ICMPv6_PING
	bool "ICMPv6 ping interfaces"
	default n
	---help---
		Provide interfaces to support application level support for
		for sending ECHO (ping) requests and associating ECHO replies.

config NET_ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR
	bool "Solicit destination addresses"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable logic to send ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation requests if
		the target IPv6 address mapping does not appear in the Neighbor
		table.

if NET_ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR

config ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR_MAXTRIES
	int "ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation retries"
	default 5
	---help---
		Send the Neighbor solicitation this number of times before giving
		up and deciding that the target IP6 address is non reachable.

config ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR_DELAYMSEC
	int "ICMPv6 neighbor re-solicit delay"
	default 20
	---help---
		Wait this number of milliseconds after sending the Neighbor
		Solicitation before checking if the IPv6 address mapping is present
		in the Neighbor Table.  This time should be related to the maximum
		round trip time on the network since it is basically the time from
		when an Neighbor Solicitation is sent until the Neighbor
		Advertisement is received.

config NET_ICMPv6_AUTOCONF
	bool "ICMPv6 auto-configuration"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable ioctl() logic that implements ICMPv6 auto configuration.
		ICMPv6 auto configuration is an alternative to DHCPv6 for obtaining
		an IPv6 address from a router.

if NET_ICMPv6_AUTOCONF

config ICMPv6_AUTOCONF_MAXTRIES
	int "ICMPv6 router solicitation retries"
	default 5
	---help---
		Send the Router solicitation this number of times before giving
		up and deciding that no router is going to provide an IP address.

config ICMPv6_AUTOCONF_DELAYMSEC
	int "ICMPv6 router re-solicit delay"
	default 20
	---help---
		Wait this number of milliseconds before re-sending the Router
		Solicitation.  This time should be related to the maximum
		round trip time on the network since it is basically the time from
		when an Router Solicitation is sent until the Router
		Advertisement is received.
