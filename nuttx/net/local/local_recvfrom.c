/****************************************************************************
 * Function: psock_recvfrom
 *
 * Description:
 *   recvfrom() receives messages from a local socket, and may be used to
 *   receive data on a socket whether or not it is connection-oriented.
 *
 *   If from is not NULL, and the underlying protocol provides the source
 *   address, this source address is filled in. The argument fromlen
 *   initialized to the size of the buffer associated with from, and modified
 *   on return to indicate the actual size of the address stored there.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   psock    A pointer to a NuttX-specific, internal socket structure
 *   buf      Buffer to receive data
 *   len      Length of buffer
 *   flags    Receive flags
 *   from     Address of source (may be NULL)
 *   fromlen  The length of the address structure
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, returns the number of characters sent.  If no data is
 *   available to be received and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown,
 *   recv() will return 0.  Otherwise, on errors, -1 is returned, and errno
 *   is set appropriately (see receive from for the complete list).
